# AI Games and Simulations

Welcome to the AI Games and Simulations repository! This repository contains various projects that demonstrate different AI techniques, algorithms, and concepts through interactive games and simulations.

## Projects

### Evolution Simulation

This project involves simulating a population of autonomous players in a 2D environment using neural networks. The players aim to collect food and reach the edges of the screen after eating. The players' actions are controlled by neural networks, which are evolved over generations to improve their performance based on specific scoring criteria.
