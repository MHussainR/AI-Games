# AI Games and Simulations

Welcome to the AI Games and Simulations repository! This repository contains various projects that demonstrate different AI techniques, algorithms, and concepts through interactive games and simulations.

## Projects

### Evolution Simulation

This project involves simulating a population of autonomous players in a 2D environment using neural networks. The players aim to collect food and reach the edges of the screen after eating. The players' actions are controlled by neural networks, which are evolved over generations to improve their performance based on specific scoring criteria.

### 2R Manipulator with Q-learning

This project implements a 2-link robotic manipulator (2R manipulator) using Pygame and applies Q-learning to control the manipulator to reach a random target within its workspace.

### 10x10 Grid Navigation with Q-learning

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of Q-learning for navigating a 10x10 grid with obstacles using the Pygame library. The agent (player) learns to reach a target position while avoiding obstacles, receiving rewards and penalties based on its actions.
